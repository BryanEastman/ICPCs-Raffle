    "# ICDM Proposed Reward Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers of the NFT project, Internet Computer Personal Computers, have recently set a vote to allow the community to decide a reward mechanism for holders.  Each month, 5% of the secondary market trades will be allocated to a pool and disbursed to holders in one of two ways.  The two options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A: ICP tokens paid out based on your weighted stake\n",
    "    * weight calculated as `7777 * 2 * NRI (NFT Rarity) + 7777`\n",
    "    * payout proportional to your share of the total stake, or the sum of your weighted scores for each NFT\n",
    "* B : Raffle entries for weighted stake\n",
    "    * same weight calc as above, allocated as \"tickets\" and a multiplier is applied for number held in the same wallet (instead of sum)\n",
    "    * by winning the drawing your ticket allocation for the next round is halved\n",
    "    * all losers' ticket allocations are doubled for the next round\n",
    "    * ticket amounts compound, accruing across rounds\n",
    "    * number of NFT's awarded are based on the pool allocation, buying as many as possible at the current floor price\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought this might be an interesting opportunity to see what the odds were based on actual wallet data. I also suggested a different formula whcih I believed might be a little fairer: `Mean NRI score * (# NFTs / 7777) * Number of consecutive raffle periods` with the idea being more emphasis is placed on holding a larger number of more rare NFT's and receiving a greater bonus for participating in consecutive rounds.  My major concern was with Whale wallets being able to unfairly game the system by playing with the probabilities of winning and statistically guaranteeing no one else wins.  Below I'll explore that idea by scraping current ICPC wallet data from DGastonia.com, running a 5 year simulation, and plotting the odds of victory with a few assumptions:\n",
    "* highest probability wins that round\n",
    "* awarded NFT's are not added to the winner's wallet (estimating NFT rewards would be hard with limited history)\n",
    "* ALL NFT's in each wallet are staked\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, taking a snapshot in time, how long would it take for the game to become fair for all players?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup and Pandas will help to pull in the data as we have most of what we need on dgastonia, number of holdings and the TI^ (probability of minting with those traits) that each wallet holds.  Unfortunately I am not sure on how to actually pull this data directly from the ICP blockchain, but I hope in the future to learn and potentially iterate on this project!"

Given each of these metrics is a little different, and differs from NRI, we can collect each of these and then use the metric we feel is most closely related to what we're measuring.  Since TI^ is the statistical proability of minting the NFT with those traits, we can use that as a proxy until I can pull in NRI reliably.  \n",
